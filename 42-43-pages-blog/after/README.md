This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

npm install` - This will install all the dependencies for the project.
2. `npx prisma db push` - This will create the database and all the tables.
3. `npx prisma db seed` - This will seed the database with data that is very similar to the data from the API.
4. You may need to run `npx prisma generate` if you get any errors about missing types. If this doesn't fix the typing errors just run the command `TypeScript: Restart TS Server` in the VSCode command palette or restart VSCode.
5. `npm run dev` - This will start the development server. There is no need for an API server anymore.


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
